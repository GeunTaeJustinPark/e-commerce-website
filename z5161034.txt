Week 2:
Defined project objectives, user stories and began work on proposal.

Week 3:
Work on proposal - defining system architecture and general style editing for cohesiveness

Week 4:
Implemented item structure and most item-related functions in backend (add, edit, remove). Spent time acquainting with React since we knew we were going to start working on more frontend-focused functionality from here on out.

Week 5:
Adjustments to item structure, adding new data fields for more advanced search & recommend functions, cleared up a duplicate set of global functions that somehow found its way in

Week 6:
Began more frontend-focused work, beginning with basic chatbot functionality (this took some time, extending into next week as I learned how to use the chosen module and work within its limitations). Assistance with various bug-fixing

Week 7:
Finished up basic chatbot functionality, allowing it to hide as a pop-up speech bubble in the corner of pages, and with basic FAQ answers.

Week 8:
Implemented some slightly more advanced chatbot functionality, including finding a built-in option for text-to-speech (but no way for the user to toggle during runtime :( ) and including it directly in the jsx for Shop page instead of the general page template - this way it only shows up on the relevant page. More various bug-fixing assistance.

Week 9:
Finally implemented all necessary chatbot functions, pending some bugs that require fixing before final submission (item recommendation returns the correct item for the *previous* search, due to React's setState updating asynchronously grr)

Week 10:
Miraculously fixed chatbot bugs literally just in time for final demo! Working on final report, assistance debugging general structure, installation testing & chasing down/fixing issues with installation on different systems
